## Deploy
1) Upload to Netlify (publish = .)
2) Edit `config.js` with your Supabase URL + anon key
3) Netlify: **Clear cache and deploy** (important)

## If it becomes blank later
- Usually Netlify cached an old bundle. Clear cache and deploy.
- Also ensure `config.js` is committed (not ignored).
- Open DevTools Console: any error will show on screen too.
